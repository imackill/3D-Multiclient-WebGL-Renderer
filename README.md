# [DEPRECATED] 3D Web Renderer
<a>Multi-Client 3D Web Renderer meant to have several clients in a single session. The clients will all ultimately have movement, and all shared objects will be rendered on each clients screen and will change accordingly. Hosted by Render.</a>

<sup>Just a note: The experimental branch only works locally because it uses ws, not wss and doesn't have a SSL certificate like the master branch does with Render's built-in certificate.</sup>
